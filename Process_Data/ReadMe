The original data files are a group of multiple json objects, each one line contains one json object. 
But since I will store the dataset in the AWS S3 bucket first, then using Lambda function to move the data file into DynamoDB. 
Thus, I need to format the file into a list of multiple json objects by using Java. 
And meanwhile,since each file contains so much data, I will split the file into a bunch of sub files.


For using the java file. You have to change the file name and rebuilt file name by yourself.
