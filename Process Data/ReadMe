The original data files are a group of multiple json objects, each one line contains one json object. 
But since I will store the dataset in the AWS S3 bucket first, then using Lambda function to move the data file into DynamoDB.
Thus, I need format the file into a list of multiple json objects by using Java. And meanwhile, since each file contains so many data, I will spilt the file into a bunch of sub files.
