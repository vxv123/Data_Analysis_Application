# Data_Analysis_Application


It is a Web Data Analysis Application for Yelp.com's business review data.

Background:
(1). This personal project is based on a project of Database System course (COEN 280 Santa Clara Univerisity).
(2). In 2013, Yelp.com has announced the “Yelp Dataset Challenge” and invited students to use this data in an innovative way and break ground in research. Students would query this dataset to extract useful information for local businesses and individual users.
The Yelp data is available in JSON format. The original Yelp dataset includes 42,153 businesses, 252,898 users, and 1,125,458 reviews from Phoenix (AZ), Las Vegas (NV), Madison (WI) in United States and Waterloo (ON) and Edinburgh (ON) in Canada. (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/). In our project, you will use a smaller and simplified dataset. This simplified dataset includes only 20,544 businesses, the reviews that are written for those businesses only, and the users that wrote those reviews.

(3). In orignal project, we used Oracle SQL to store dataset and used Java to process the data and display GUI. 
(4).** But in this presonal project, I do some changes, the datasets are stored in AWS DynamoDB and I will display graphic user interface on the website using js and process data using Java and Python.**
